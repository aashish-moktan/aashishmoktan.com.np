lead: 'Projects for creative people are my favorite thing. The website, created with Eleventy of course, uses the great Wilco font from simplebits. For the layout and color scheme I was inspired by the program series of the Manchester Literature Festival 2018. A small easteregg is the octave that sounds on desktop size when hovering over the menu.'
