  title: I love turning ideas into reality.
  intro: Navigating the fullstack cosmos for 3+ years, I’ve orchestrated digital symphonies—crafting nimble Node.js backends, weaving Express.js into robust APIs, and sculpting databases that hum with efficiency. I build bridges between pixel-perfect interfaces and server-side logic, prioritizing clean code, frictionless performance, and accessibility. Whether optimizing MongoDB’s dance or tuning PostgreSQL’s rhythm, I thrive where data meets creativity, turning complex stacks into seamless, scalable stories.

I architect applications that sprint — optimizing backend logic to slice latency, frontend bundles to shed bloat, and databases to serve only what’s essential. Every interface I build balances intuition with ==accessibility, ensuring seamless navigation for all users==, whether on a desktop or a dial-up connection.

I code ecosystems from the ground up, using my own battle-tested Node.js/Express foundation. Templates? They’re for IKEA furniture. Your project gets a blueprint, not a photocopy.

Why this matters:

1. Speed as doctrine: APIs that fire like neurons, React/Vue components that load lighter than a PDF, and databases (MongoDB/PostgreSQL) tuned like Formula 1 engines.
2. Full autonomy: I debug, scale, and secure every layer — no third-party ghosts haunting your codebase.
3. Semantic by design: Clean markup, structured data, and content that humans (and search engines) crave. No SEO bandaids required.
4. Boundless creativity: From real-time dashboards to AI-augmented APIs — if you dream it, we engineer it.
