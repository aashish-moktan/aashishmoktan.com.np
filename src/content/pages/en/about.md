I’ve always enjoyed working with code and building applications. In 2022, I began my journey as a backend developer using Node.js and Express, creating server-side logic and APIs that power web applications.

Early on, I focused mainly on backend development, but soon realized the importance of understanding frontend technologies as well. I picked up HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript to better integrate the user interface with the backend services.

In those early days, I wore many hats—developing backend systems, dabbling in frontend design, managing databases, and occasionally handling deployment. Today, I continue to specialize in backend development while maintaining a solid grasp of frontend fundamentals to build seamless, full-stack experiences.

I’m passionate about writing clean, efficient code and continuously exploring new tools and best practices to improve performance, security, and scalability in every project I take on.

My focus has always been on building robust APIs, scalable backend systems, and smooth integrations that power personal projects, marketing sites, and small applications designed to deliver real value and <sparkly-text class="pl-2xs" number-of-sparkles="5" style="--sparkly-text-color: var(--color-accent)">**great user experiences.**</sparkly-text>
