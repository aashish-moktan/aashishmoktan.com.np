Spanish has become like a native language for me, and the American spelling just feels more natural. That said, I'm certainly not consistent with it, and British spelling likely appears somewhere."
    - summary: "How did you learn web development and design? "
      contents: "I'm still learning, certainly for a lifetime. It's the eternal repetition of learning and applying: building something. I always read some book about bash scripts, typography, grid layouts, JavaScript, web components. I read articles that people from the community so lovingly provide. When I build a new project, I always try to learn something new in the process. And so everything becomes more and more natural, logical, easy, and better, over time."

I’ve always enjoyed working with code and building applications. In 2022, I began my journey as a backend developer using Node.js and Express, creating server-side logic and APIs that power web applications.

Early on, I focused mainly on backend development, but soon realized the importance of understanding frontend technologies as well. I picked up HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript to better integrate the user interface with the backend services.

In those early days, I wore many hats—developing backend systems, dabbling in frontend design, managing databases, and occasionally handling deployment. Today, I continue to specialize in backend development while maintaining a solid grasp of frontend fundamentals to build seamless, full-stack experiences.

I’m passionate about writing clean, efficient code and continuously exploring new tools and best practices to improve performance, security, and scalability in every project I take on.

My focus has always been on building robust APIs, scalable backend systems, and smooth integrations that power personal projects, marketing sites, and small applications designed to deliver real value and <sparkly-text class="pl-2xs" number-of-sparkles="5" style="--sparkly-text-color: var(--color-accent)">**great user experiences.**</sparkly-text>
