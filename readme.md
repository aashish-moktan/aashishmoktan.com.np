## License

This is my personal website. I use a lot of code fragments that smarter people than me have come up with - thanks to writing about it, or keeping their code open source. I'm happy to share my code as well! Please feel free to use parts of the code of this website in your own projects, but please don't copy the page completely, as it's **not meant to be a template**.

## Credits and Thank yous

**Andy Bell**

I like working with Andy's CSS methodology CUBE, going hand in hand with [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/). Andy has published an approach that incorporates Tailwind CSS into his methodology, as a tool to create custom utility classes. This workflow is built into my website, and really all websites I am building since discovering it. Also, I learned much about how to use Eleventy in 2020 with Andy's (now free) course.

**Bernard Nijenhuis**

The open graph images are generated automatically: First a SVG is created for every post, which is then converted to JPEG. I learned how to do that with Bernard's article.

**Aleksandr Hovhannisyan**

Aleksandr is an inspiration for good code organization. The 301 redirect solution I'm using is from their blog.
